# MovieTracker
A electron desktop app to keep track of my movies using mongodb.

Custom names and connection strings have to be added and then compiled into a app if you want to use this program. All of which are in the index.html.

MongoDB file structure:

        {
            "Name": "300",
            "Own": "ALL",
            "Type": "Digital",
            "Source": "Google Play"
        }
