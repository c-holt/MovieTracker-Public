# MovieTracker
A electron desktop app to keep track of my family's movies using mongodb. Lets face it, there are many sources to buy from and it becomes very difficult to keep track of what you already own. Movies Anywhere attempted to solve that, but because they also sell movies, some companies didn't want their movies listed with them. This program is simply a list stored on mongodb so my family can keep a copy of the program and add to the list anytime they buy a new movie on any platform.

Custom names and connection strings have to be added and then compiled into a app if you want to use this program. All of which are in the index.html.

MongoDB file structure:

        {
            "Name": "300",
            "Own": "ALL",
            "Type": "Digital",
            "Source": "Google Play"
        }
